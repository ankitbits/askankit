I write for myself. Writing helps me organise and expand on my thoughts. Writing also helps clear my head for new thoughts.

Articles here are written succinctly and may have unintentional biases and inaccuracies — you’re welcome to point them out to me. 

Some of my learnings on product, growth and entrepreneurship are also included here. 
These learnings are derived from my personal experiences and from experiences of dozens of other PMs/ founders / coaches who took time to write about their learnings for others consume and build amazing stuff.

Opinions expire fast as I learn more. I publish here to connect with people on similar journeys and make new friends.
