*(This post is inspired by Ben Horowitz’s famous ‘[Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/)’ post. I have documented my thoughts on API product management here.)*

***Good API PMs embrace API as a product, and not just as a piece of code*.** They look at APIs from product point of view — something that has real human users. Something that is desirable and usable. Something that’s feasible for us to build, market and make money from — sufficient in and itself. They realise they they sit between the producer (the dev colleague), the consumer (the dev customer) and the sponsor (business), and that they need to bring value to each of these parties — just like how they do for traditional products.

Bad API PMs look at APIs from code / IT lenses. They project manage the interaction between the producer and the consumer and assume product responsibility only towards the sponsor which renders them ineffective or redundant.


***Good API PMs are hands on with technology***. They understand how things work. They understand what is feasible, what is not. They understand industry standards and best practices. If they don’t, they are open about it and take their time to get upto speed with things. They are the first users of their products. They recognise that they can’t add value if they can’t understand the language of both business and technology. They need to use this language to define and evangelise the value. They get themselves the understanding required to make important tradeoffs pertaining feasibility and usability.

Bad API PMs operate in a zone of partial, cluttered, fragmented understanding. This limits their capability to see things clearly when it comes to understanding customer (developer) pain points, engineering (developer) bottlenecks and challenges and future possibilities. They contribute only half their potential as PMs.

***Good API PMs delight the developers***. They empower the developers. They solve for developer autonomy. They realise that developer portal is their store front. They realise that great documentation wins them sales battles. They build incredible developer tools — dev guides, API references, API playgrounds, tutorials, cookbooks, code snippets, sample apps, dev support desk, dev communities etc. They optimise for developer experience.

Bad API PMs focus only on business stakeholders. They understand the requirements as shared by business and work with engineering to build the APIs. (Remember PMs in enterprise feature factories? Solving for functionality, ignoring UX)? They ignore the developer experience. Even worse, they delegate API adoption to deliver teams who work with developers to help them adopt the product.

***Good API PMs think platform*.** They understand that they sit almost at the bottom of pyramid when it comes to value creation. They understand that their actions (both positive and negative) have domino effect across the value chain. So, they think higher order. They think ahead of time. They think of problems that customers are not even thinking of right now. They think modular. They anticipate future requirements, use cases and power user scenarios. They understand that they need to optimise for architecture design as much as or more than they need to optimise for velocity. They understand sunk cost of bad decisions at foundation level. They think upgrades and backward compatibility.

Bad API PMs operate reactively. They think short term. This keeps them in firefighting mode. This renders the platform inflexible and unscalable.

***Good API PMs think backwards from the API reference***. API reference is the UI for API product. Good API PMs write great API spec. They work outside in keeping developers interest at the heart of problem solving. They define the resource utility, the request spec, the response spec and the errors.

Bad API PM define the business requirement leaving the API contract definition to engineering. This is like working only with backend engineering team, leaving the UI devs on their own without any design support.

***Good API PMs excel at packaging*.** The understand the market, the use cases, the breadth of capabilities they have and leverage this understanding to package the API in varied SKUs. They play a pivotal role in deciding the packing aspects of the products — bundling, rate limiting, security, error handling, traffic management, billing, strategic integrations etc., leading to better monetisation.

Bad API PMs leave the packaging to business, or execute the packaging as suggested by business rendering themselves a project role.

***Good API PMs have a 360° view on their API lifecycle***. Good API PM understand the entire build, publish, manage lifecycle of their product and they can add value to all stages. They can define a good API product with a great developer experience. They can package the APIs so that it can be monetised and adopted well. They measure the developer engagement and API performance with adequate instrumentation in place. Finally, they understand enterprise security and compliance requirements and can take trade off calls if required.

Bad products managers operate at low latitude and do not have visibility, or 360° understanding of the entire API lifecycle.
