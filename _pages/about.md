# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi ðŸ‘‹! Welcome.

I'm Ankit, based in Bangalore, India. 

Iâ€™ve been a founder and a product, growth professional for 10+ years. I love understanding how the world works â€” one insight at a time. Building stuff is my approach to gaining insights and contributing back after internalising them.

At AskAnkit Consulting, I co-pilot with early-stage founders to lead product growth and monetisation. 
View my portfolio [here](https://askankit.me/portfolio-2/).â€‚[Work with me](https://askankit.me/work-with-me/).

Iâ€™m a curious human. I read vicariously for my love of learning and to view the world from the POV of fellow learned beings. I like reflecting and writing helps me with that.
