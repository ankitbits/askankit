I write for myself. Writing helps me organise and expand on my thoughts. Writing also helps clear my head for new thoughts.

Articles here are written succinctly and may have unintentional biases and inaccuracies — you’re welcome to point them out to me.

Opinions expire fast as I learn more. I publish here to connect with people on similar journeys and make new friends.
