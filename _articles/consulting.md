---

I work with early-stage founders and embed with their teams to drive outcomes, through hands-on execution.

1/ I work with 0 → 1 startups on:

– Customer discovery

– Accelerating validations

– Building & iterating MVP as a 1st PM

– Hiring across product, design & engineering

– GTM & traction

2/ I help mature organisation with recruiting and interviewing for product roles.

I start ASAP — 3 to 7 days and onboard blazing fast with an objective to create significant impact in a short time.

- We’ll decide termination clause (notice period) upfront.
- We’ll sign a standard non-disclosure agreement (NDA), so you can be assured and we collaborate without any inhibitions.
